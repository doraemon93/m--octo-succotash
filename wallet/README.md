# Wallet implementation for Witnet

## Running the Wallet

The Wallet executable is self-documented, so you can just start with:

``` shell
> cargo run -- wallet --help
```

## Wallet API

The Wallet server API is described in the [Developer Docs](https://docs.witnet.io/developer/wallet-api/) section of the [Witnet documentation](https://docs.witnet.io).
